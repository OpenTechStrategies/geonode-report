  It's hard to tell exactly what the licensing is for this 
  zoom level of imagery.

* Partners maps

  The source for the partners PNG maps is:

    https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1Jfhvj95vGhkLF0cpEFCGcr5aqFQ

  The source for the coding events PNG maps is:

    https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=12qzPNe7kcohY-_DpEHcFsXC45_Y

  Note that the coding events PDF files predate the PNG files.  The
  PDFs were added in commit c8b4dc7d45.  Unlike the PNG images, the
  PDFs have the legends on the left side; but we probably don't want
  the legend in our final publication, in which case we should use the
  PNGs anyway.
