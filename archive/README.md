This archive includes only publicly-available or non-confidential
source materials related to the GeoNode project's history and
OpenDRI's investment in it.  We keep interview notes and other
sensitive documents (e.g., hackathon attendance spreadsheets that
include people's real names and email addresses) in a private
location.  So if you see something here that you think shouldn't be
here, please let `kfogel {_AT_} opentechstrategies.com` know.
