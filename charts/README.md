# Mailing List Activity

  The GeoNode forums were on Google Groups for a while, then moved to
  self-hosted Mailman in early 2015.  We've looked at both, though the
  code with which we did it is kind of disorganized.  For Google
  Groups, the place to start is ../src/discussion-forum-stats.sh and
  ../src/google-groups-activity.*.  For the Mailman lists, things are
  a bit more organized: the entry point is ../src/mailman-activity.sh,
  and the resultant chart images

# Time-to-fix charts

The time-to-fix charts were generated by VizGrimoireR, as discussed in
visualization_documentation.md.  They show the time in hours to close a
given ticket, as discussed in [this Bitergia blog
post](https://blog.bitergia.com/2012/08/07/updated-data-about-kdevelop/#more-57).
That post also links to a presentation which may be relevant.

# num-orgs/

We ended up not using the stuff in the num-orgs/ directory.  Cecilia
knows more about it.
