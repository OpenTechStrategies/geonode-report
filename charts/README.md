# Time-to-fix charts

The time-to-fix charts were generated by VizGrimoireR, as discussed in
visualization_documentation.md.  They show the time in hours to close a
given ticket, as discussed in [this Bitergia blog
post](https://blog.bitergia.com/2012/08/07/updated-data-about-kdevelop/#more-57).
That post also links to a presentation which may be relevant.

# num-orgs/

We ended up not using the stuff in the num-orgs/ directory.  Cecilia
knows more about it.
